# NeuralNetwork

## Intro

This project encompasses the implementation of a neural network (NN) and a simple snake game featuring multiple snakes, 
each controlled by its respective NN. The NN is defined by its genotype, which is a list of genes specifying how to 
construct the NN. An evolutionary algorithm is employed to modify these genes, and improve the subsequent 
generations of NN to become better at playing the snake game.

## Be aware: if I find time, I'll make the project more readable. However, at the current moment, you will have to make sense of it on your own.
### I implemented various approaches that, in the end, did not produce the expected results; the project is littered with such unused code.
